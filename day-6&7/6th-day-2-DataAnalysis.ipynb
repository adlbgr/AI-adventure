       " \"quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  the restaurant seemed fairly full even on a tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.\\n\\nmy friend and i had sampled sandwiches at the farm kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  the crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  both were very good; i didn't even know how much i liked raw radishes and turnips until i tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.\\n\\nfor entrees, i ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  this isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  for our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine i ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as i had requested.  also, they didn't offer us bread, but i will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  we received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  yum.\\n\\nthe entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  my lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  but our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.\\n\\nif the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  if i return, i'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.\",\n",

[/rant off]\\n\\nthe atmosphere at vintage 95 is very close to my ideal. i\\'d go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. seriously - go check out the patio. it is exactly what a patio hangout bar should be. exactly.\\n\\ncaroline and i told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. it wasn\\'t initmate, but we weren\\'t looking for intimate. and speaking of the bar, even though v95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they do have booze. i\\'m not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal glenfiddich /glenlivit /glenmorangie trio to which most places are limited. i had a couple of drums of ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but i was celebrating so i didn\\'t care.) caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder i love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. \\n\\nthe limited happy hour menu had some very interesting choices. we settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. the bruschetta was very nice and quite unusual. you get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. they were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but i really liked it. the tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. caroline said it was unique and i say it was just darn delicious. \\n\\nthings being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. a friend had told us \"you have to try the vintage burger\", so we did. it came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. recommended. the burger was very tasty. they obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin\\'s were tasty. highly recommended.\\n\\nin for a dime, in for a dollar, right? so we ordered dessert. again, the dessert menu is short, but i\\'m okay with that as long as they do it well. chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn\\'t remember. i\\'m allergic to hazelnut and don\\'t like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.\\n\\nlike everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn\\'t find it anywhere else. it was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. it was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. i didn\\'t realize it was hazelnut until i\\'d had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.\\n\\nat this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn\\'t. we told the waiter who told the manager, (gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if i needed emergency assistance. i didn\\'t, i\\'m not that allergic.)  frankly, their response was exactly the kind of customer service you want to see. anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. but i must give big kudos to gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.\\n\\nwe will defintely be back and i strongly recommend you put it on your list too.',\n",

       " 'bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it.  we had lunch at nourish a few months ago and while we weren\\'t overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  i ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  as i have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, i asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that i\\'d had.  the server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which i opted for.  my husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. \\n\\nafter an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  my egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item i have ever consumed.  the air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however i didn\\'t realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  the sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and i only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  as bad as my meal was, my husband\\'s veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  the \"quinoa crust\" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  the vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  the dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than i could handle even in just the one bite that i tasted.  i honestly don\\'t know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.\\n\\nwe also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made \"extra spicy\" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  while nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.',\n",

       " \"i have been visiting mrs. white's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent food network recommendation - i almost got cold feet.\\n\\ngood thing i didn't. the food is as awesome as ever. the service is much as it has always been. be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto tv reviews, mrs. white's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. the service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at mrs. white's. if you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. mrs. white's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. if you want scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.\\n\\nwhen you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. there are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. this is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. in these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. if they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. \\n\\ni often call ahead to verify if they have what i want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was ok because if forced me to try new things back then, mrs. white's was open monday through friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but i'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. i'd just come back on another day. \\n\\nto say i have the utmost respect for the white family would be an understatement, today i was afraid i might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. i do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of the golden rule cafe. they are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with mrs. white's.\\n\\ni love this place and hope i always will.\",\n",

(and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)\\n\\nour first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  my husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  for an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  the herbs were fresh and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!\\n\\nfor entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  i am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that\\'s agreeing with me.  i asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said \"we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it\"....what??  the dishes are made to order??  i haven\\'t heard that at a lot of restaurants!  after about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  they were heavenly!  so many flavors and so fresh!!\\n\\nour second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and mast va mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but i like the sabzi better.  the entrees we had were amazing...i had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.\\n\\noverall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant\\'s atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.',\n",

       " \"i went here last night with my wife to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary.  we purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  there wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  champagne for her and a martini for me.  the hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  when we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.\\n\\ni made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  the table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  the host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.\\n\\nthe place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  the 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and i don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  i don't know about you but i like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  the noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.\\n\\nour waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as i would have liked.  i especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  also, i'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.\\n\\nthe food:\\n\\n* fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  they are excellent especially the truffle ones.  my only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  i would have liked them fresh but whatever.\\n* wedge salad - just ok.  the blue cheese and bacon were great though.  it just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge i am used to and was looking forward to.\\n* burrata cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good\\n* truffled mac n' cheese - not the best i've ever had but still pretty good.  not as thick and cheesy as i would have liked and they use weird noodles.\\n* wagyu beef trio - my wife and i shared this.  perfect amount for the both of us to share.  each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  i still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  the sides were also very good.  we especially liked the mushrooms.  the mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.\\n* beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  the sauces are equally awesome.\\n\\nall-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  good food, good wine, good company.  i would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.\",\n",
